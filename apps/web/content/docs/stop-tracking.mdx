title: Stop tracking
---

To stop track a channel, you can use the `/untrack` command. You can select a channel by either typing it's name and selecting it among the options.

![Autocomplete](/docs/channel-autocomplete-untrack.png)

Or by copy-pasting their channel ID.

## Don't see a channel?

The autocomplete for `/untrack` only shows channels that are being tracked in the current channel you're in. If you don't see a channel, that might mean that the channel isn't being tracked. Try [tracking the channel](/docs/start-tracking) first.

## Any problems?

If you don't see a message like that, make sure to check `/tracking` to see if it is on the list. If it doesn't, make sure to contact us on [Discord](/discord).
