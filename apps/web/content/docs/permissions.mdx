When you add Statistical to your Discord server, it requests the following permissions:

But why do we need these permissions?

## Send Messages

This is needed to send update messages in the channel you've used to track a YouTube channel.

## Embed Links and Attach Files

This is needed to send the update embed whenever a channel recieves a subscriber update.

`Attach Files` is also needed to send images of graphs when clicking on the `View growth graphs` button or by running `/channel`.

## Mention @everyone, @here, and All Roles

This is needed for when `ping_role` is specified when tracking a channel. Learn more about the `ping_role` option in the [tracking documentation](/docs/start-tracking#ping-role).

If you don't plan on using `ping_role`, you can disable the permission. You can always enable it later if you need to.
